### General Info

This project utilized HTML and CSS to build a responsive adn stylish portfolio page. In the page, there is a about me section, links to the github repositories, and a contact section. Building from scratch, the webpage was structured then used CSS to add style. To accomplish the layout, Flexbox was utilized allowing us to format the page this way. 

This project taught me how to completely build a portfolio webpage and to solve various CSS issues. I especially learned to better understand flexbox and how it works in the works section to create a grid like layout. 

A problem I ran into was adjusting the responsiveness of the page. While the layout for fullscreen and mobile are satisfactory, any sizes between resulted in a margin or some spacing on the right cutting off the page content as seen below. I spent a good amount of time on fixing this issue but I was not able to find a solution. In the future, I hope to better understand the issue and potentially solve it in order to make the website as responsive as possible.
